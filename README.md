## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing user data, exercise information, and training programs.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model application data.
